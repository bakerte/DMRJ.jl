# DMRjulia.jl
A general purpose tensor network library in the julia programming language

Hello! Welcome to the future site of the full release of DMRjulia, a tensor network library for physics computations written in julia. Right now, ground state calculations on the MPS are available (v0.8.0) for both quantum numbers and dense tensors.

If you're just starting out, I recommend reading the introduction article at http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11566 (English starting on page 19, accepted at the Canadian Journal of Physics) and beginning in the /examples folder.

If you want to view documentation in the code, open the julia terminal, type "?" and type the name of the function.  There is a lot of good information that can help you there.
