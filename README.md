# dmrjulia
A general purpose tensor network library in the julia programming language

Hello! Welcome to the future site of the full release of DMRjulia, a tensor network library for physics computations written in julia. Right now, ground state calculations on the MPS are available.

Timeline for release of full features:
  + August-September 2020: Full documentation of ground-state
  + August-November 2020: Full release of time and other methods for the MPS
  + ~January 2021: More advanced solvers

If you're just starting out, I recommend reading the introduction article at http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11566 (English starting on page 19) and beginning in the /examples folder

A friendlier and more comprehensive introduction is coming soon!
